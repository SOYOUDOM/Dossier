## 2.1.0 — 2026-09-07

**The assistant analyses instead of photocopying.**

2.0.0 had an architectural flaw. Runbooks travelled to the endpoint as an
index — titles and trigger phrases, never the bodies — and `readRunbook`
rendered the card *in the app*. So the procedure never reached the model. It
could not reason about a step it had not read, and the only move left to it
was announcing that it would go and look something up. The answer on screen
was the stored runbook, verbatim, with `<policy>` still in the SQL.

Fixed by matching **before** sending. Matching is local and costs nothing, so
the two or three runbooks that match the person's own words now travel whole,
in `workspace.runbooksMatched` — steps, checks, escalation. The endpoint reads
the real procedure and answers with what the document cannot give you: which
step matters here, what to check first, what each outcome means, and what not
to waste time on. The full runbook is still drawn underneath, as reference.

- **The answer is rendered above the card**, not below it. Cards used to be
  appended the moment the action ran, which put the procedure above the
  sentence explaining it
- **Identifiers are pulled out of the question** and substituted into the
  checks, so the SQL on screen carries the real policy number instead of
  `<policy>` for somebody to fill in by hand at eleven at night
- **Configuration placeholders are called out.** `<policy>` is a value and
  gets filled; `<COI_REQUEST>` is a table nobody has named yet, is left alone,
  and the card says which ones still need setting. A plausible invented table
  name gets run, so it must never be invented
- **Matching handles inflection.** "COI not generating" now matches the
  trigger "coi not generated" — people type the tense they are in, not the
  phrase in the runbook. On the reported case this took the score from 20 to
  48
- **Naming a system is no longer enough to surface a runbook.** "The imaging
  queue is stuck" used to drag up the COI procedure on the strength of the
  word *imaging* alone; a runbook now needs its own words to have been said
- Each matched runbook carries `confidence` and `why` — which phrases hit —
  so a weak match can be offered as a guess rather than an answer

Prompt rules 9c–9f rewritten. **Repaste §4 of `POWER-AUTOMATE.md`** — without
it the assistant will keep photocopying, because the old rules told it to.

560 assertions across seventeen suites, no failures.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-09-07

The release that turns Dossier from a personal tracker into something a
support team can share.

### The BAU library

A support library that can actually grow, in three layers.

- **Runbooks** — one symptom and what to do about it, *not* one document. A
  guideline file usually holds six or eight distinct problems; split apart
  they can be found, left whole they cannot. Each carries trigger phrases
  (what somebody actually types, error text included), ordered steps, the
  queries that prove what is wrong, escalation, owner, and when a human last
  confirmed it.
- **System profiles** — what is durably true about a system, especially what
  it *lies* about. *regenCOI returns 200 whether or not it produced a letter.*
  One line that answers a family of tickets no runbook covers.
- **Memory** — unchanged. Still the personal notebook it always was.

**Runbooks travel to the flow as an index, never as bodies** — title, system,
triggers, severity, freshness, about 15 tokens each. Measured on the starter
library: 1,012 bytes for the index against 5,513 for the bodies. At a hundred
runbooks that is the difference between 1.5 KB and half a megabyte on every
question. The steps and the SQL stay local until `readRunbook` asks for one by
name. Profiles are the exception and travel whole, because there are few of
them and they are what reasons about an unknown symptom.

Nine new actions — `findRunbook`, `readRunbook`, `listRunbooks`,
`readProfile`, `startRunbook`, `saveRunbook`, `verifyRunbook`,
`deleteRunbook`, `saveProfile`.

**All of it works with the flow switched off.** The matcher is local and needs
no network. The endpoint adds language, not capability.

- Starting a runbook raises a record with its steps already on the checklist,
  so the work is tracked and there is evidence of what was done
- **Make a runbook from this** on any record — the library builds itself out
  of work you already did, which is the only way libraries ever get built
- Everything arrives as a **draft**: imports, what the assistant writes, what
  you capture. Approving is a human act, and there is no path to it from the
  endpoint
- Anything unconfirmed for a year shows as unchecked wherever it appears
- **Export and import the whole library as one file** — merged by title with
  the newer edit winning, so two people can both add runbooks and neither
  loses theirs. No shared drive needed

### The assistant

- `draftEmail` writes an email and shows it as a draft with Copy and *Open in
  my mail app*. Nothing is sent — Dossier has no mail credentials and its CSP
  has no outbound permission, so the draft is text until you send it
- `setTheme` and `setSetting` change the application's own settings from a
  whitelist of 15 keys. `settings.flow` — the endpoint URL — is deliberately
  not on it, and the refusal lives in the executor rather than the
  confirmation dialogue, so it holds even with confirmation turned off
- Chat redesigned: skins, toggleable motion, a confirm-or-don't switch, and
  confirmations moved out of the thread into a card that resolves to a
  one-line receipt

### Fixed

- **The email body rendered invisible.** `chatDraft` gave it `class="mb"`,
  which is already the row menu button — 25×25, `opacity:0` until its row is
  hovered. `.chmail .mb` overrode padding and colour but never width, height
  or opacity, so the text was in the DOM, correct, and rendered into a
  transparent 25-pixel square. Copy worked the whole time because it read the
  data directly. Renamed to `.mbody`
- **Code arrived without its fence.** A model that writes `csharp` on a line
  and forgets the backticks now still gets a code panel: `chatMend` repairs an
  unclosed fence, and a bare language name standing over something that reads
  like code. Both repairs are conservative — a language word over prose is
  left alone, and a sentence after the block stays out of the panel
- **Undo never covered the library.** `pushUndo` only ever snapshotted
  `S.tasks`, so the Undo offered after forgetting a memory note restored the
  records and left the note deleted. It now takes a snapshot covering memory,
  runbooks and profiles
- **New runbooks looked freshly checked.** `rbNormalise` stamped `verified`
  with today when the field was empty, which would have made every import and
  every written procedure look confirmed — the exact lie the field exists to
  catch
- An explicitly named system now outranks a system name that merely appears in
  the sentence, so asking about Imaging cannot surface the payment runbook
  because the word "payment" was in the question
- Attachments no longer blow the token budget: images are shrunk through a
  ladder before sending, and the reachability probe identifies itself instead
  of posting an empty body

### Interface

- **The version now sits at the right-hand end of the status bar.** Clicking
  it copies the build line. This matters more than it looks: the app is shared
  by sending the file, so five people can be running five different copies,
  and *"it does not do that on mine"* is a real conversation
- Address lines on an email draft are shown even when empty, and `bcc` was
  added throughout — schema, card, Copy and the mailto link

### Documents

- `flow/BAU-RUNBOOKS.md` — new. How a runbook is shaped, how to decompose
  existing `.docx` guidelines into them, and how a team shares the library
  with no shared drive
- `flow/runbooks-starter.json` — new. Three runbooks and two profiles built
  from real support situations, with every table and team name left as an
  angle-bracketed placeholder. A shape to copy, not content to trust
- `flow/CONTRACT.md` — the action reference is now generated from the sample
  payload, so the document, the code and the wire format cannot drift apart
- `flow/POWER-AUTOMATE.md` — prompt rules 9c–9g for the library, seven new
  worked examples, and the note that **the library needs no flow change**:
  `workspace` is passed whole, so the new blocks ride along inside it

### Upgrading from the previous build

Replace the files. Then:

1. **Repaste §4 of `POWER-AUTOMATE.md`** into your AI Builder prompt. This is
   the only required step, and without it the assistant will not reach for the
   library
2. Import `flow/runbooks-starter.json` from Menu → Setup → Runbooks, and
   replace its placeholders with your real table and team names
3. The Parse JSON schema does **not** need changing — Parse JSON does not
   strip properties its schema omits. Update it only if you want the new
   fields as dynamic content of their own

Nothing in your workspace needs migrating. `settings.runbooks` and
`settings.profiles` are created empty on first use.

### Tested

535 assertions across sixteen browser and Node suites, no failures.
